Hi, Welcome to my homepage!

I am a third year PhD student in the department of [Computer Science](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/) at [UW-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), where I am advised by [Prof. Jerry Zhu](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jerryzhu/index.html). Previously, I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering from [IIT Kanpur](https://cse.iitk.ac.in) where I was supervised by [Prof. Piyush Rai](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/piyush/) and Prof. Harish Karnick.

 My research interest lies broadly in Machine Learning spanning topics in  Reinforcement Learning, Machine Teaching and Fairness.
In my free time, I enjoy cooking, yoga and meditation. 

You can reach me at first_name_initial+last_name at wisc.edu.
